HTTP (Hyper Text Transmit Protocol) - communication protocol used to transmit the data over the internet.
transmits the data in plain text.
not safe, compared to HTTPS, data transmitted is not encrypted.

HTTP request content:
    1) start line (http version, method - GET(get information), POST(create information), PUT(update information), DELETE(remove information), folders and parameters)
    2) headers (host, token, )
    3) blank line (separates headers from the body)
    4) body (request parameters(usernames, passwords, content, etc))

HTTP response content:
    1) start line (http version, status code, )
    2) headers (cookie, response size, response type, )
    3) blank line (separates headers from the body)
    4) body (content of the requested information(resources, objects, web objects, web pages, etc))

HTTP idempotence - The method can be repeated as many times as you want, and the result will always remain the same.
    1) GET - YES (retrieving information is safe)
    2) POST - NO (creating a record over and over again should not be allowed)
    3) PUT - YES (the same change applied to item over and over again is not a problem)
    4) DELETE - YES (you can delete as many times as you want, the same resource cannot be deleted twice anyway)
