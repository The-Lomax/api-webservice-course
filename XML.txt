XML - eXtensible Markup Language

defined by HTTP header line: content-type: application/xml
HTTP body: XML

XML uses tags <> just like HTML, but the meaning of the tags is different and the types of the tags change.

W3C created XML and HTML (probably that's where the similarity comes from)

XML schema defines a layout of the correctly formatted XML, for a particular service.
Schemas ensure that as long as the XML file is following the rules laid out in the schema document,
the service will work correctly. Otherwise it will return an error.
