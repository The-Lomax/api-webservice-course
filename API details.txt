API functioning process:
1) REQUEST is being made by the interface (can be a client application sending a request to the program)
2) Program is ran in the application to PROCESS the request
3) Application sends back RESPONSE with the requested information (or result of information processing, depending on the request type)

example:
1. user types in keyword to search in Google
2. user clicks search
3. search engine sends a search query request to google program to return search results
4. program located at google is being ran to process the information
5. application at google is returning the search results back to the interface

example:
1. user sends a HTTP request directly to the application to create an order
2. the order related information is included with the request
3. application interface runs the program at ebay that creates an order
4. order creation program is ran to create the requested order
5. application at ebay sends back the result of creating the program back to the interface (can be UI), containing success/failure and/or the orderID and/or other information
