REST - Representational State Transfer.
Bases its structure on object data.
Can use all API methods (get put post delete).
Can use all data types.
Created by Roy Fielding in 2001.
Cross platform compatible.

Principal of REST is that you don't work on the actual resource but on the representation of it.
