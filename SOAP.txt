SOAP - Simple Object Access Protocol.

It is one of the ways to access web services.
Rules to form HTTP request or response.
Uses a WSDL (Web Services Description Language).

4 HTTP request parts are defined by SOAP:
    - Start line - POST WSDL HTTP Version
    - Header line - Content-Type: text/xml
    - Blank line
    - Body - XML envelope formed using WSDL

SOAP uses XML. W3C created SOAP.
